## Data Source

All data contained here was sourced from the [Final Statistical Abstract][DMI_FSA] provided by the [Division of Management Information at The University of Illinois][DMI].  The data provided by DMI has changed over time and is a mix of Excel, HTML, and PDF formats; the data here is the same data as a single CSV file. In cases where the FSA contains statistics for multiple semesters in a year, this dataset includes the **fall semester**.
