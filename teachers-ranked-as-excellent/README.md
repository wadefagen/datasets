## Background

At the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, every semester students complete an [Instructor and Course Evaluation (ICES)][ICES_CITL] questionnaire for each course they are enrolled.  The [Center for Innovation in Teaching and Learning (CITL)][MAIN_CITL] compiles this data into the list of "Teachers Ranked as Excellent" and publishes the names of those teaches in the local newspaper and [online as a PDF][TRE_CITL].
