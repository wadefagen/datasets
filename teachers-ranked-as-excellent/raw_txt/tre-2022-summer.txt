              LIST OF TEACHERS RANKED AS EXCELLENT BY THEIR STUDENTS

                                      Summer 2022
                         (Based on Data Collected Summer 2022)



The results from the Summer 2022 administration of student ratings of
instruction are included in this list. Results are based on the ratings
from the Instructor and Course Evaluation System (ICES) maintained by
Measurement and Evaluation in the Center for Innovation in Teaching and
Learning.

The list is necessarily incomplete. Instructors who did not have students
evaluate their classes or chose to use a form other than those reported here
have no opportunity to be included. For some instructors who did use these
forms, there is also the possibility that they chose not to be included in
the list. For these reasons, in the past we adopted the title “An Incomplete
List of Teachers Ranked as Excellent by Their Students.” These reasons
still hold and the list is still ‘incomplete’ but we have taken “Incomplete”
out of the title. The results are presented in department alphabetical
order. Criteria for inclusion follow.

PREPARATION OF RESULTS

This list is based on ICES forms completed by students during the Summer
semester of 2022. Only those instructors who distributed ICES forms at
least once during this time period and who released their data for
publication are included in the list.

Only numerical data from the ICES questionnaire results were used, and at
least five students must have responded in each class.

Special Notice: In the past, to be included on the list instructors needed
to be rated among the top 30% across campus in their respective Elective-
Mixed-Required course group. Beginning with the Fall 2000 semester ICES
results, our office has shifted to a set of criterion cutoffs for the List.
The ICES average (mean) ratings needed to make the List of Teachers Ranked
as Excellent by Their Students are listed in the table. Faculty must meet
the requirements for both Item 1 (“Rate the Instructor’s Overall Teaching
Effectiveness”) and Item 2 (“Rate the Overall Quality of this Course”).
Teaching assistants must meet the requirement for only Item 1.

INTERPRETATION OF LIST

Instructors' names are listed alphabetically within each department. The
specific courses that were used in the ratings are indicated by the course
numbers that follow the instructor's name.

      The symbols used in the list have the following meaning:

      T.A. - Teaching Assistant
         * - The instructor ratings were outstanding.



The list of excellent teachers was compiled by staff at Measurement and
Evaluation in the Center for Innovation in Teaching and Learning. More
information about the list may be obtained by contacting Measurement and
Evaluation, 247 Armory Building, 244-3846, ices@illinois.edu. Recent lists
can be found on the Web at go.illinois.edu/lotrae.
