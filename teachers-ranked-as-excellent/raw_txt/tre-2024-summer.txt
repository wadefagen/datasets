       List of Teachers Ranked as Excellent by Their Students
                                     Summer 2024
                         (Based on Data Collected Summer 2024)

The results from the Summer 2024 administration of student ratings of instruction are
included in this list. Results are based on the ratings from the Instructor and Course Evaluation
System (ICES) maintained by Measurement and Evaluation in the Center for Innovation in
Teaching and Learning.
The list is necessarily incomplete. Instructors who did not have students evaluate their classes
or chose to use a form other than those reported here have no opportunity to be included. For
some instructors who did use these forms, there is also the possibility that they chose not to
be included in the list. For these reasons, in the past we adopted the title “An Incomplete List
of Teachers Ranked as Excellent by Their Students.” These reasons still hold, and the list is still
‘incomplete’ but we have taken “Incomplete” out of the title. The results are presented in
department alphabetical order. Criteria for inclusion follows.

Preparation
This list is based on ICES forms completed by students during the Summer 2024 semester.
Only those instructors who administered ICES at least once during this time and who released
their data for publication are included in the list.
Only numerical data from the ICES questionnaire results were used, and at least five students
must have responded in each class.
Special Notice: In the past, to be included on the list instructors needed to be rated among the
top 30% across campus in their respective Elective-Mixed-Required course group. Beginning
with the Fall 2000 semester ICES results, our office has shifted to a set of criterion cutoffs for
the List. The ICES average (mean) ratings needed to make the List of Teachers Ranked as
Excellent by Their Students are listed in the table. Faculty must meet the requirements for
both Item 1 (“Rate the Instructor’s Overall Teaching Effectiveness”) and Item 2 (“Rate the
Overall Quality of this Course”). Teaching assistants must meet the requirement for only
Item 1.
